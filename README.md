## Project Walk-Thru
### The User
This app was designed for users to have an easy way to track residents of The Arconia, the infamous Upper West Side residence that has been the setting of Only Murders in the Building. With this app, the user is able to enter the world of The Arconia and make their own roster of suspects, investigators, and victim to track their characters as they watch along with the show. 

## Features
This application was meant to explore and test knowledge of Next.js and React. A few key features of this app include:
- User specific data through Google Authentication
- The ablity to view all current characters the user has added to the database (READ)
- The user can add a new character (CREATE)
- Additionally, the user can edit current characters (UPDATE)
- If the user has decided they no longer want to have the character as a part of their roster, they can delete them from the app all together (DELETE)
